Hi,
I am a self-taught developer, I have completed two significant projects on the MERN stack and believe I have the skill and relevant hands-on experience necessary to excel in this position.
Throughout my self-learning journey, I have acquired a range of technical skills including proficiency in javascript, node js, express,mongoDB, and react. I also tried to learn about cloud platforms like AWS and I succeeded in that by hosting two projects on AWS.
I am excited about the prospect of joining your team and contributing my skills to the development of innovative technologies. My passion for web development and self-motivated learning has driven me to continuously seek new challenges and opportunities to grow my skill.
I have attached my resume for you to look over.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
