 Implemented an API that retrieves student details from a MongoDB database on atlas and returns the data in a paginated manner.
 The API can accept parameters such as page number and page size to allow pagination.Also implemented server-side filtering functionality in the backend.
 The filtering will should allow the UI to send filter criteria to the backend API, which will then return the filtered results to the UI.
 
 TEST URLs:
 
 Creating user: localhost:5050/student/createStudent
 
 Getting user: localhost:5050/student/getStudents?page=2&pageSize=5
 
 Filtering user: localhost:5050/student/filter?page=1&pageSize=5
